# HNET Browser is a part of HNET project

HNET is an Internet browser designed for users who wish to access the Internet in a non-visual or combined auditory and visual way. This includes blind or partially sighted users, people with dyslexia or learning difficulties, and users who are learning new languages.

HNET is designed to interact directly with the information on a web page, and to translate it into speech, as well as providing a magnified visual display. The user may navigate through the structure of a document based on its contents: links, headings and paragraphs, rather than having to deal with scrolling and interpreting a complex screen lay-out. The basic format used on the Web is called HTML. The intelligence built into HNET understands the HTML constructs and automatically presents them in a logical sequence, greatly simplifying navigation of even complex documents.

The HNET Privacy Browser is first ever web browser built on Chromium (like Google's Chrome browser) engineered to protect your privacy. HNET is in always-on "private browsing mode", so on close of HNET all browsing data is deleted (while you're browsing as little as possible is stored). HNET has removed all Google tracking and blocks hundreds of other companies from tracking you.
