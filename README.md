# HNETBrowser
The HNET Privacy Browser is first ever web browser built on Chromium (like Google's Chrome browser) engineered to protect your privacy. HNET is in always-on "private browsing mode", so on close of HNET all browsing data is deleted (while you're browsing as little as possible is stored). HNET has removed all Google tracking and blocks hundreds of other companies from tracking you.
